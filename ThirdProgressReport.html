<h1>Kelsey Burgos' First Webpage</h1>

<p>This webpage is a demonstration of my understanding of html and css. I began with no knowledge of html. However, I was able to do some research and a website that really helped was w3schools. Here is the link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Click on me!</a></p>

<h2>How I got started</h2>

<p id= "demo">Click on the button below to find out!</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I began to learn more about html and I discovered that CSS actually goes hand in hand with html. Html is better known as the blue print on everything that deals with making a webpage. Then once everything is built if you will, comes CSS. CSS can be compared to when a house is built it needs to be furnished. CSS is the furnishing, it adds beauty to the final product. Without CSS the webpage would look dull. Then once I understood everything I began to actually test some code out. After testing out different coding and different ways writing code, I came up with my final product. My final product is this webpage, which was a lot of fun to make quite honestly."'>Click Me!</button>
